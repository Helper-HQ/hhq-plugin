# Triage Inbox — Admin Helper

You are helping the user clear and categorise their inbox. Pull the most recent threads, look at headers (sender + subject + snippet), classify each into one of four buckets, present the result in a tight list, and on approval apply the labels + archives in bulk. Done in two-to-three minutes for a typical morning inbox.

This is a **read-then-write** skill — read everything first, propose actions, ask for one approval, apply in bulk. Don't act on individual items as you go.

## When this skill runs

Trigger on:

- "triage my inbox"
- "clean up my inbox"
- "what needs my attention"
- "what's in my inbox today"
- "let's go through my inbox"
- "process my inbox"
- "show me what's waiting"
- `/hhq:triage-inbox`

Don't trigger on generic "check email" — only on explicit triage / cleanup intent.

### Autonomous mode (scheduled routines)

If the invocation prompt contains the word `auto`, `autonomous`, or `--auto`, OR the prompt clearly comes from a Cowork scheduled routine (e.g. "scheduled triage run", "routine triage"), enter **autonomous mode**:

- **Skip Phase 4's approval gate.** Apply all proposed actions immediately after classification.
- **Don't ask follow-up questions.** No "edit / cancel" prompt, no per-thread review.
- **Don't try to capture new rules conversationally.** Rule capture (Phase 5 "Capture rules conversationally") is interactive-only — there's no user to confirm. Existing user-taught rules from Step 0e DO still apply (Pass A in Phase 3); the routine just can't learn new ones.
- **Phase 6 still runs** — report what was done, including any errors. The user reads the summary when they next see the chat.
- **Empty inbox** → exit silently (no "all clear" noise on a routine).
- **Auth or Gmail-connection failure** → log a one-line note ("triage routine skipped — Gmail not connected"), don't halt loudly.

The justification: label changes are reversible (the user can drop a label in Gmail in two clicks), so the cost of a wrong call is low. Manual invocation still gates on approval — autonomous mode is opt-in via the routine, not the default.

If neither autonomous keyword nor routine context is present, run the standard interactive flow with the Phase 4 approval gate.

## Architecture note — labels do most of the work

This skill assumes the user has run `/hhq:setup-gmail-labels` (auto-chained from `/hhq:connect-gmail`). The 5 HHQ labels (To Do / Awaiting Reply / FYI / Notifications / Newsletters) are the targets for triage classification.

Two of those labels — **Notifications** and **Newsletters** — are also auto-applied by the background sync (every 15 min), so by the time the user runs triage, most newsletters / machine notifications are already out of the inbox. Triage focuses on the **3 judgment buckets** (To Do / Awaiting Reply / FYI) for what's still in inbox after the auto-rules ran.

If the user hasn't set up labels yet, fall back to the legacy 4-bucket flow described in the "Legacy fallback" section at the bottom — applies a single `HHQ/Low priority` label + archives the can-archive bucket. Keeps triage usable even before label setup.

## Phase 0 — Auth + Gmail connection check

### Step 0a — Get the project folder

Use `mcp__ccd_directory__request_directory`. Save as `<project-dir>`. Fallback `~/.hhq/sales-helper/`.

### Step 0b — Resolve auth

Read `<project-dir>/.hhq-session.json`. Same refresh-on-near-expiry pattern as every other skill. Halt with `/hhq:connect` prompt if missing.

### Step 0c — Confirm extended Gmail access

`GET <backend_url>/api/me/gmail/connection` with `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.

Branch on the response:

- `{"connected": true, "email": "..."}` → continue.
- `{"connected": false}` → halt with:
  > "Triage uses Helper HQ's direct Gmail integration (extended Gmail access — beta). You're not connected yet. Run `/hhq:onboard` to opt in, or `/hhq:connect-gmail` if you already have approval."
- Any error → surface honestly, halt.

This skill **does not work** with Cowork's generic Gmail connector — that connector doesn't expose `archive_thread`, `trash_thread`, `label_thread`, or `list_inbox`. Extended Gmail access is the only path.

### Step 0d — Resolve label config

`GET <backend_url>/api/me/gmail/labels/config`.

- `is_setup: true` AND every enabled label has a `gmail_label_id` → use the **5-bucket flow** (Phase 1 onwards). Cache the `{canonical: gmail_label_id}` map.
- `is_setup: false` → user hasn't run `/hhq:setup-gmail-labels`. Two options:
  - Offer to run setup inline: "You haven't set up Helper HQ labels yet — want to do that now? It takes ~30 seconds and unlocks the full triage flow. (yes / use legacy single-label triage / cancel)"
  - If user says "use legacy", drop into the **Legacy fallback** flow at the bottom of this skill.
  - If user says "yes", trigger the `setup-gmail-labels` skill, then resume here.

### Step 0e — Load triage rules + custom labels

`GET <backend_url>/api/me/triage-rules` → array of user-taught rules, already sorted by priority desc / id asc. Cache as `<rules>`. Empty array is fine (most users start with no rules).

`GET <backend_url>/api/me/gmail/labels/custom` → user's custom labels (anything beyond the 5 canonical defaults). Cache as `<custom_labels>` keyed by id, so when a rule's `target_custom_label_id` fires you can resolve to a `gmail_label_id` + `archive_on_apply` / `mark_read_on_apply` flags.

If either request 4xxs, log a one-line note and continue with empty arrays — rules + custom labels are augmentation, not blockers.

## Phase 1 — Pull the inbox

`POST <backend_url>/api/mcp/gmail/list_inbox` with body:

```json
{ "max_results": 50 }
```

The default 50 is right for a morning triage — large enough to clear a backlog, small enough that AI classification is fast. The user can ask for more by saying "triage 100" or similar — bump `max_results` accordingly (cap 100 per the API).

Optional: if the user said "unread only" or similar, add `"query": "is:unread"`. Standard Gmail search syntax works in the `query` field.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "threads": [
    {
      "thread_id": "abc123",
      "snippet": "Hi Brad, just following up on...",
      "from": "Sarah Khan <sarah@acme.com>",
      "subject": "Re: Pricing for 50 seats",
      "date": "Wed, 1 May 2026 09:00:00 +0000",
      "message_count": 3,
      "label_ids": ["INBOX", "UNREAD"]
    }, ...
  ],
  "next_page_token": null,
  "result_size_estimate": 50
}
```

If `threads` is empty, tell the user "Nothing in your inbox to triage — all clear." and stop.

**Note whether there's more:** if `next_page_token` is non-null, there are more than 50 threads waiting. Remember this for the Phase 6 summary so you can prompt the user to run triage again.

## Phase 2 — Look up senders against contacts

For each thread, parse the sender email out of the `from` field (e.g. `Sarah Khan <sarah@acme.com>` → `sarah@acme.com`). Then for the unique senders, batch-look-up against the user's contacts:

`GET <backend_url>/api/me/contacts?per_page=500` (paged if needed) — same endpoint sync-gmail uses for context. Build a map `{lowercase_email: {first_name, company, pipeline_stage_id, relationship_type}}`.

Use this to enrich each thread with sender context for display:

- If sender is a known contact with `relationship_type` containing `prospect` AND a non-terminal pipeline stage → "**prospect** in your sales pipeline"
- If `customer` → "**customer**"
- If `partner` / `supplier` → "**partner**" / "**supplier**"
- If `email_contact` only → just show the name, no badge
- If no match → unknown sender (leave neutral)

This context is for HUMAN reading in Phase 4 — it doesn't change classification rules in Phase 3. But it should bias the user's review (an "action required" item from a known prospect is higher-stakes than from an unknown sender).

## Phase 3 — Classify each thread

Three passes, in order. The first pass that yields a target wins; later passes don't run for that thread.

### Pass A — User-taught rules (deterministic, free, fast)

For each thread, evaluate the cached `<rules>` from Step 0e in order (already priority-sorted). Each rule has `pattern_type` (`sender_email` / `sender_domain` / `subject_keyword` / `snippet_keyword` / `current_label`) and `pattern_value` — match the thread's `from` / `subject` / `snippet` / cross-referenced canonical labels (derived from `label_ids` via the label config map).

Match logic (mirrors backend `TriageRuleEngine` — keep them in sync):
- `sender_email` → exact match against the thread's parsed sender email (lowercased both sides).
- `sender_domain` → exact match against the part after `@` (lowercased).
- `subject_keyword` → case-insensitive substring of `subject`.
- `snippet_keyword` → case-insensitive substring of `snippet`.
- `current_label` → the canonical name (e.g. `awaiting_reply`) appears in the thread's currently-applied HHQ canonical labels.

On first match, the rule's target is the bucket. The target is either:
- `target_canonical` → one of the 5 canonical buckets (apply per the same rules in Pass C below).
- `target_custom_label_id` → look up in `<custom_labels>`, get `display_name`, `gmail_label_id`, `archive_on_apply`, `mark_read_on_apply`. Apply that label per its flags.

Track which rule fired for which thread so the Phase 5 summary can show "(rule: from @stripe.com → Notifications)" when relevant.

### Pass B — Pre-classification override: Awaiting Reply → To Do on inbound

Before falling through to AI, check if the thread is currently labelled `awaiting_reply` (the user's `gmail_label_id` for that bucket from `/api/me/gmail/labels/config`) AND there is a new inbound message — i.e. the thread is back in `INBOX` (the `INBOX` label is present in `label_ids`, which only happens when Gmail re-delivers a thread on a new reply) — then classify as `to_do` regardless of subject/snippet patterns. The other party has replied; the ball is back in the user's court.

In Phase 5, this means *removing* the `awaiting_reply` label and *adding* `to_do` (plus *adding* `INBOX` is implicit — the thread's already there). Skip the `archive_on_apply` for `to_do` (it stays in inbox by design).

If the thread is `awaiting_reply` but NOT in `INBOX` (i.e. nothing new has come in), leave it alone — don't reclassify, don't surface it in the triage list. It's correctly archived and waiting.

### Pass C — AI classification (only for unmatched threads)

For threads that didn't match a rule and didn't trigger the awaiting-reply override, classify into ONE of the 5 canonical buckets based on `subject`, `from`, `snippet`, and `label_ids`. **Use only the data we already have — DO NOT call `get_thread` for bodies.** Triage runs on metadata; per-thread body reads happen later (in `draft-reply` or `surface-followups`) when the user picks one to action.

### Buckets (5-label flow)

The 5 canonical labels map to AI classification buckets. Most newsletters / notifications are already filtered out by the auto-rules before triage runs, so in practice you'll see far fewer of those — but the rules still need to handle the case where one slipped through.

**`to_do`** → `HHQ/To Do` label, **stays in inbox**.
Needs action / response / decision from the user.
Signal patterns: questions in subject ("Quick question", "Can you...?"), explicit asks ("Could you let me know", "Need your sign-off", "Waiting on you"), `UNREAD` label, threads where the latest message is from someone else, anything from a known prospect / customer / partner that looks like substantive content. Calendar invites needing RSVP.

**`awaiting_reply`** → `HHQ/Awaiting Reply` label, **archived from inbox**.
User has already responded; ball is in the other party's court. Should be tracked but doesn't need inbox attention until they reply.
Signal patterns: latest message in thread is from the user, no recent inbound after, "will get back to you" style replies the user just sent.

**`fyi`** → `HHQ/FYI` label, **archived + marked read**.
Info-only — read it once, no action. Includes "thanks!" replies, project status updates, scheduling confirmations the user isn't the primary actor on.
Signal patterns: short acknowledgements ("got it, thanks"), cc'd threads where the user isn't the primary recipient, automated reports from people (not machines), non-urgent FYIs.

**`notifications`** → `HHQ/Notifications` label, **archived + marked read**.
Machine-sent — should mostly be auto-handled by the background sync, but catches any that slipped through.
Signal patterns: From `noreply@` / `no-reply@` / `notifications@` / `system@`, password resets, verification codes, system alerts.

**`newsletters`** → `HHQ/Newsletters` label, **archived + marked read**.
Subscription / marketing — should mostly be auto-handled by the background sync (List-Unsubscribe header detection), but catches any without that header.
Signal patterns: "Your weekly digest", "Update from <brand>", marketing language, footers mentioning unsubscribe even when no header present.

### Disambiguation rules (within Pass C)

- If unsure between `to_do` and `fyi`: prefer `to_do` for unknown senders (safer false positive), prefer `fyi` for known low-stakes senders (CCs from your own team about non-actioned items, etc.).
- If from a known **prospect** in active pipeline stage AND looks like substantive content: at minimum `to_do`. Never `notifications` or `newsletters` even if pattern would match.
- If from a known **customer**: same — never `notifications` / `newsletters`.
- Anything from a sender on the user's `personal` relationship_type list: `fyi` minimum, hands-off bias.
- Calendar invites needing RSVP from any known sender → `to_do`.
- If a label is **disabled** in the user's config (e.g. they turned off `awaiting_reply`), don't classify into that bucket — pick the next best fit.

### Why the auto-rules matter

If the background sync has been running, by the time the user runs triage:
- Most newsletters are already labelled + archived (List-Unsubscribe detection)
- Most machine notifications are already labelled + archived (`noreply@` patterns)
- The inbox you're triaging is mostly **human-sent emails needing judgment** — exactly the cases that need AI categorisation

So in practice the `notifications` and `newsletters` buckets in triage will be small or empty for users with the auto-rules running. That's the intended behaviour.

## Phase 4 — Present the categorised list

Group the threads by bucket. Only render buckets that have items. Skip empty buckets entirely.

```
**Inbox triage — 35 threads**

═══ HHQ/To Do (12) — stays in inbox ═══

  • Sarah Khan (prospect) — Re: Pricing for 50 seats
  • Greg Cole (prospect) — Quick question on integration
  • Marcus Jones — Can you confirm the Tuesday call?
  ... (etc)

═══ HHQ/Awaiting Reply (8) — archived ═══

  • Anna Patel (customer) — Re: Quarterly review
  ... (etc)

═══ HHQ/FYI (12) — archived + marked read ═══

  • Team standup notes — yesterday
  • Project status weekly — Sprint 14
  ... (etc)

═══ HHQ/Notifications (2) — archived + marked read ═══

  • Stripe — Verification code
  ... (auto-rules usually catch these — these are stragglers)

═══ HHQ/Newsletters (1) — archived + marked read ═══

  • Some sender without unsubscribe header — Update
  ... (auto-rules usually catch these too)

**Proposed actions per the bucket settings:**
- Apply HHQ/To Do to 12 threads — kept in inbox
- Apply HHQ/Awaiting Reply to 8 threads — archived from inbox
- Apply HHQ/FYI to 12 threads — archived + marked read
- Apply HHQ/Notifications to 2 threads — archived + marked read
- Apply HHQ/Newsletters to 1 thread — archived + marked read

Apply all? (yes / no / edit)
```

Notes on rendering:

- **Cap at ~15 threads visible per bucket** (down from earlier 25 — five buckets means more total). Show "(plus N more)" if exceeded.
- **One line per thread:** sender name (with badge if a known contact), em-dash, subject. No date, no snippet.
- **No thread IDs visible** — track internally.
- **Skip empty buckets** in the rendered list to keep it scannable.
- **Use the user's display_name** for each label (from `/api/me/gmail/labels/config`) — if they renamed `HHQ/To Do` to `Action`, show `Action (12)` not `HHQ/To Do (12)`.

## Phase 5 — Handle the user's response

### Yes / approve / "go" / similar

Apply the actions per the user's label config (from Phase 0d). For each thread in each bucket:

1. **Look up the canonical label entry** — get `gmail_label_id`, `archive_on_apply`, `mark_read_on_apply`.
2. **Build the label modification:**
   - Always add the canonical label_id
   - If `archive_on_apply: true` → also remove `INBOX`
   - If `mark_read_on_apply: true` → also remove `UNREAD`
3. **Apply via `POST /api/mcp/gmail/label_thread`** for the add, AND `POST /api/mcp/gmail/unlabel_thread` for each remove. One thread can take 1-3 API calls.

   *(Implementation note: the MCP currently exposes single-action label/unlabel/archive endpoints. To save API calls, future optimisation could batch these into a single `modify_thread` endpoint that takes both add + remove arrays — same shape as the backend's `GmailService::modifyThread` already supports internally. For V1 the sequential calls are acceptable.)*

   Skip any label entry where `gmail_label_id` is missing — that label wasn't set up. Surface to the user: "Skipping `<canonical>` (label wasn't created — run `/hhq:setup-gmail-labels` to fix)."

### No / cancel / "actually no"

Stop. Apply nothing. Tell the user:
> "Nothing applied — your inbox is unchanged. Run again any time."

### Edit / "let me change some"

Conversational mode. The user can say:
- "Move Sarah Khan to action required" → recategorise that thread
- "Don't archive the LinkedIn one — keep it" → move from `can_archive` to `low_priority` (or whatever they want)
- "Archive everything in low priority too" → flip all `low_priority` to `can_archive`
- "Skip the apply" → cancel without applying

Accept changes, re-render the updated list, ask "Apply now? (yes / no / more changes)".

#### Capture rules conversationally

If a user's edit looks like a *general pattern* rather than a one-off — phrasing like "always", "any", "all", "every time", "from now on", "going forward", "anything from `<sender or domain>`", "any `<keyword>` ones" — offer to save it as a triage rule so it applies automatically next run.

Examples:
- "Move all missed payment ones to To Be Paid" → propose saving rule `subject_keyword: missed payment` → custom label `To Be Paid`. If `To Be Paid` doesn't exist as a custom label, offer to create it (`POST /api/me/gmail/labels/custom` with `display_name: "To Be Paid"` — backend namespaces under `HHQ/`), then create the rule.
- "Anything from @stripe.com is a notification" → propose `sender_domain: stripe.com` → canonical `notifications`.
- "Move Sarah's emails to To Do" (and Sarah is a known contact) → propose `sender_email: sarah@acme.com` → canonical `to_do`.
- "Archive any newsletter from substack" → propose `sender_domain: substack.com` → canonical `newsletters`.

Ask once before saving:
> "Want to save this as a rule? Next time it'll apply automatically. (yes / no / yes but tweak it first)"

If yes:
1. If a custom target label is needed and doesn't exist yet, `POST /api/me/gmail/labels/custom` to create it (the backend creates the Gmail-side label too).
2. `POST /api/me/triage-rules` with `pattern_type`, `pattern_value`, target (`target_canonical` OR `target_custom_label_id`), and `captured_from_skill: true` so we know it came from this conversational flow.
3. Apply the rule's effect to the current bucket as the user requested, then continue with the rest of the apply step.

If "tweak", let the user adjust the pattern (e.g. "actually make it `subject_keyword: payment overdue` instead") then save.

If no, just apply this one as a one-off.

Don't ask on a one-off edit ("move *this* email to FYI" — singular, no general pattern). Only ask when the user's phrasing implies a recurring rule.

## Phase 6 — Report what was done

After the actions complete, brief summary:

> "Triage done.
>
> - **HHQ/To Do** (12) — labelled, kept in inbox.
> - **HHQ/Awaiting Reply** (8) — labelled + archived.
> - **HHQ/FYI** (12) — labelled + archived + marked read.
> - **HHQ/Notifications** (2) — labelled + archived + marked read.
> - **HHQ/Newsletters** (1) — labelled + archived + marked read.
>
> Your inbox now shows the 12 items that need you. Open Gmail to action them."

Use the user's display_name for each label in the summary.

**If `next_page_token` was non-null in Phase 1** (more than 50 threads in inbox), append a follow-up nudge:

> "Heads up — your inbox had more than 50 threads. Run `/hhq:triage-inbox` again to clear the next batch."

If any action failed (e.g. Gmail API error on a specific thread), report it honestly:
> "Heads up: failed to apply HHQ/To Do to 1 thread (Gmail returned 404 — it may have been deleted in another tab). The other 11 applied cleanly."

## Legacy fallback (pre-label-setup users)

If the user runs triage before completing `/hhq:setup-gmail-labels` AND chose to use legacy mode (Phase 0d), fall back to the simpler 4-bucket flow:

- `action_required` → leave in inbox, no label
- `waiting_on_reply` → leave in inbox, no label
- `low_priority` → apply `HHQ/Low priority` label (create if missing via `create_label`)
- `can_archive` → archive via `archive_thread`

This is the pre-v0.21 behaviour. It works without label setup but loses the auto-rules + the richer 5-bucket categorisation. Encourage the user to run `/hhq:setup-gmail-labels` to upgrade.

## Things you must NOT do

- Do NOT call `get_thread` during triage. Triage is metadata-only — bodies are read in `draft-reply` or `surface-followups` per pick. Privacy contract from v0.13.
- Do NOT permanently delete anything. The skill uses `archive_thread` (removes INBOX label only) and the optional `trash_thread` (Gmail soft-trash, 30-day recovery). The MCP doesn't expose permanent delete and never will.
- Do NOT apply category labels in Phase 5 to the `action_required` or `waiting_on_reply` buckets. The point of those buckets is "stays visible in inbox unchanged" — labelling them adds clutter.
- Do NOT loop the user through one-by-one approval in Phase 4 by default. Default UX is "approve all" — fast. Only enter per-item edit mode when the user explicitly asks ("edit", "let me change some").
- Do NOT auto-trash anything without an explicit user request. `trash_thread` is reserved for items the user explicitly says "bin" or "delete" on. The default action for `can_archive` is **archive**, not trash.
- Do NOT run on the Cowork generic Gmail connector. It doesn't expose `list_inbox`, `archive_thread`, `label_thread`, or `unlabel_thread`. Phase 0c gates on extended Gmail access for a reason — fail honestly if it's missing rather than degrading silently.
- Do NOT classify based on body content you don't have. The classification in Phase 3 uses only `subject`, `from`, `snippet`, and `label_ids`. If the snippet doesn't give enough signal, default to `low_priority` — safer than a false `can_archive`.
- Do NOT modify `<project-dir>/.hhq-session.json` except for JWT refresh.

## Edge cases to handle gracefully

- **Empty inbox** → "Nothing to triage — all clear." Stop.
- **All items end up in `action_required`** → no archives or labels to apply. Just report: "20 items, all need your attention. Nothing automated. Open Gmail." No bulk action prompt.
- **Gmail rate limit mid-apply** → halt, report what completed + what didn't, suggest retry in a few minutes.
- **Sender lookup fails (backend down for `/api/me/contacts`)** → continue without contact context. Show senders without badges. Don't block triage on the lookup.
- **The `HHQ/Low priority` label was renamed by the user in Gmail** → the label still exists by ID. We look up by NAME each run — if no exact-name match, we'd create a duplicate. Acceptable for V1 (rare).
- **Thread's INBOX label was already removed in another Gmail tab between list and apply** → archive returns 200 (no-op). Label_thread might 404 if label was deleted — surface as a single-thread error in the summary.
- **User says "show me 200 threads"** → cap at 100 (the MCP's hard limit). Tell them "Showing the most recent 100; run again for the next batch."
